# Daxle Workspace

Welcome to the `daxle` workspace. This repository contains a collection of Dart and Flutter packages designed to provide robust functional programming constructs and utility abstractions.

## Goal

The primary goal of this workspace is to enhance Dart and Flutter development by offering:
- **Safety**: explicit handling of optional values and failures.
- **Expressiveness**: functional programming patterns that lead to cleaner, more readable code.
- **Productivity**: common utilities and abstractions missing from the core libraries.

## Packages

| Package | Description | Version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [daxle](packages/daxle/) | Core utility package offering functional types like `Option`, `Result`, `Either`, and `Lazy`. | [![Pub](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/daxle.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/daxle) |
| [daxle_flutter](packages/daxle_flutter/) | Flutter-specific extensions and utilities built on top of `daxle`, including ViewModel and more. | [![Pub](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/daxle_flutter.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/daxle_flutter) |
